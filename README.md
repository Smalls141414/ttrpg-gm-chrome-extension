# TTRPG GM Tool Extension
## Description
A chrome extension built to help people running a campaign for a Table-Top Role Playing Game (TTRPG) as a Game Master (GM). This tool is focused around allowing quick access to resources that a GM would need during the course of a virtual TTRPG session, specifically utilizing Dungeons and Dragons 5th Edition. Basic currently planned features are listed here.
## Features
Opening up the extension, users will find themselves faces with three major features:

 - Spell Search
 - Name Search
 - Reward Search

### Spell Search
Users will be able to see a textbox as well as a seach button. If the user is confused about a Dungeons and Dragons 5th Edition spell, the user will be able to type into the textbox the name of the spell they are confused about and the search functionality will open up a new tab with the ruleset courtesy of the D&D 5e Wikidot.
### Name Search
Users will be able to select the race of a character they need a randomized name of and the function will choose a random name from a list for that character race. Users will be able to edit these lists as well as add custom races to add more names into. Preset names for the Dungeons and Dragons 5th Edition Players Handbook races will be present.
### Reward Search
Users will be able to select the rarity of a random reward they would like and one will be presented to them. Similar to name search, users will be able to edit these lists. Both Reward and Name Search will display at the bottom of the extension page.
